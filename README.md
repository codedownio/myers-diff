This is a fast Haskell implementation of the Myers text diff algorithm[^1]. It is heavily inspired by the Python version in [this post](https://blog.robertelder.org/diff-algorithm/), and should have the same $O(\min(len(a), len(b)))$ space complexity. The implementation uses unboxed mutable vectors for performance.

This repo also can also build a couple other versions for benchmarking comparison, gated behind flags.

* `-funi_myers` will build the version from the [uni-util](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uni-util-2.3.0.3/docs/Util-Myers.html) package.
* `-fdiff` will use the [Diff](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Diff) package.

## Comparison to other libraries

The [Diff](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Diff) package also implements the Myers algorithm, but a less space-efficient variant. That package advertises $O(D^2)$ space complexity, where $D$ is the number of differences between the two inputs. In the worst case, $D = \max(len(a), len(b))$, so the space usage can be quadratic in the input length.
