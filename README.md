This is a fast Haskell implementation of the Myers text diff algorithm[^1]. It is heavily inspired by the Python version in [this post](https://blog.robertelder.org/diff-algorithm/), and should have the same `O(min(len(a), len(b)))` space complexity. (By contrast, the [Diff](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Diff) package advertises `O(ab)` space complexity.) The implementation uses unboxed mutable vectors for performance.

This repo also can also build a couple other versions for benchmarking comparison, gated behind flags.

* `-funi_myers` will build the version from the [uni-util](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uni-util-2.3.0.3/docs/Util-Myers.html) package.
* `-fdiff_myers` will use the [Diff](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Diff) package.
